    <p class="privacy__text">
      Ketone.dev ("KETONE") is a fasting tracking application. As a company operating in the digital health and wellness
      sector, we are committed to protecting our users' personal data. You will find the KETONE Privacy Policy below. It
      explains our practices and commitments regarding the processing of your personal data. We implement a process of
      continuous improvement of our compliance with global data protection standards, including the General Data
      Protection Regulation (GDPR), to ensure the best level of protection for your personal data.
    </p>

    <section class="privacy__section">
      <h2 class="privacy__subtitle">Who is responsible for processing your personal data?</h2>
      <p class="privacy__text">
        Within the meaning of the GDPR, the controller is the entity that defines the purpose(s) and manner of use of
        your personal data. The data controller is KETONE, whose correspondence address is:
      </p>
      <address class="privacy__address">
        Ketone.dev<br />
        Queretaro, Mexico
      </address>
      <p class="privacy__text">
        This means that we are your point of contact for any questions or concerns relating to the collection and use of
        this data. You can contact our Data Protection Officer at
        <a href="mailto:contact@ketone.dev" class="privacy__link">contact@ketone.dev</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="privacy__text">
        KETONE publishes the website <a href="https://ketone.dev/" class="privacy__link">https://ketone.dev/</a> and the
        mobile application, which helps you track your fasting cycles without advertising. Using the site is also
        completely free. As part of our operations, we may collect and process personal data about our users. This
        Privacy Policy outlines these data processing operations.
      </p>

    <section class="privacy__section">
      <h2 class="privacy__subtitle">What data is collected about you and for what reasons?</h2>

      <h3 class="privacy__heading">1. Connecting to Ketone Services</h3>
      <p class="privacy__text">
        When you connect to the KETONE website or app, the host automatically collects certain data about your device
        (e.g., computer, smartphone, or tablet) and browser. This includes your IP address and device identifiers. This
        data is collected to establish a connection between your terminal and the app's servers, as well as to detect
        bugs (design flaws in computer programs that cause malfunctions) and attempted cyberattacks. The collection and
        processing of this data is justified by KETONE's legitimate interest in providing a functional and secure app
        that is suitable for various types of terminals and operating systems on the market. These data are kept for one
        year following their collection. Upon account deletion, all connection logs and technical data associated with
        your account are permanently removed from our database.
      </p>

      <h3 class="privacy__heading">2. Account creation and management of registered users</h3>
      <p class="privacy__text">
        <strong>Information needed to create an account:</strong> We collect the information you provided to us when you
        registered, such as your email address. In order to ensure the proper monitoring of your fasting history, we
        also keep a record of your fasting cycles (start times, end times, and durations). This data processing enables
        KETONE to manage its registered users, which is justified by the execution of the contract to which you are a
        party: the KETONE Terms of Service.
      </p>
      <p class="privacy__text">
        <strong>Voluntary submission of health and preference data:</strong> You may choose to customize your experience
        by entering optional details such as your name, age, gender, weight goals, mood logs, or specific fasting
        protocols (e.g., 16:8, OMAD). By voluntarily entering this data, you are explicitly granting us consent to store
        and use it strictly for the proper functioning of the application and to provide you with the requested tracking
        services.
      </p>
      <p class="privacy__text">
        <strong>Account Deletion and Complete Data Removal:</strong> When you delete your account, all personal data
        associated with your account is immediately and permanently deleted from our database. This includes your email
        address, fasting history, health metrics, preferences, and any other information you provided. We do not retain
        any backup copies or archives of your personal data after account deletion. Your data is completely and
        irreversibly removed from our systems.
      </p>

      <h3 class="privacy__heading">3. Technical support</h3>
      <p class="privacy__text">
        When you ask us to solve a technical problem, we collect information such as your email address and name, the
        date and time of your request, and the circumstances of the reported problem. Additionally, our technical team
        may need to access your account to address an issue or perform a requested action on your behalf. This data
        processing is justified by KETONE's legitimate interest in offering technical support to its users. Upon account
        deletion, all technical support records associated with your account are permanently removed from our database.
      </p>

      <h3 class="privacy__heading">4. Improvement of our services</h3>
      <p class="privacy__text">
        We use data related to the use of our tracking tools to improve these services and make them more effective for
        our users. The data processed for this includes navigation data of users on our services and aggregate
        statistics on feature usage. This data processing is justified by KETONE's legitimate interest in developing and
        improving its services. We only keep this data for as long as necessary for the analysis, allowing us to
        identify areas for improving our services. Upon account deletion, all individual usage data linked to your
        account is permanently deleted. Only anonymized, aggregated statistics that cannot be traced back to you may be
        retained for service improvement purposes.
      </p>

      <h3 class="privacy__heading">5. Fraud prevention</h3>
      <p class="privacy__text">
        In order to prevent fraud on our app and in particular the malicious multiplication of accounts or spam, we
        collect a certain amount of information such as your email address and IP address. This data processing is based
        on KETONE's legitimate interest in preventing and combating fraud on its platform. Upon account deletion, all
        fraud prevention data associated with your account is permanently removed from our database.
      </p>

      <h3 class="privacy__heading">6. Donations</h3>
      <p class="privacy__text">
        KETONE is a free application, but we gratefully accept optional donations to support our development. We do not
        directly process banking transactions or store your credit card information. All financial transactions are
        handled securely by third-party payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Patreon, Stripe). However, when you make a
        donation, we receive a confirmation that includes your name, email address, and the donation amount.
      </p>
      <p class="privacy__text">
        <strong>Management of the donation:</strong> We keep this record to track the support we receive. This
        processing is justified by KETONE's legitimate interest in managing its fundraising and relationship with
        donors.
      </p>
      <p class="privacy__text">
        <strong>Public Acknowledgment:</strong> With your explicit consent, we may publish your name in our
        acknowledgments section to recognize your support. This data processing is based on your consent. This data is
        publicly visible until you withdraw your consent. You can ask us to remove your name from the public list at any
        time by contacting us.
      </p>
      <p class="privacy__text">
        Upon account deletion, all donation records associated with your account are permanently removed from our
        database, and your name is removed from any public acknowledgment lists.
      </p>

      <h3 class="privacy__heading">7. Litigation management (possible or current)</h3>
      <p class="privacy__text">
        <strong>Exception to Immediate Deletion:</strong> If your account is subject to an active legal dispute or
        investigation at the time of deletion request, we may be legally required to retain relevant data until the
        matter is resolved. In such cases, we will notify you and retain only the minimum data necessary to comply with
        legal obligations. Once the legal matter is concluded, all retained data will be permanently deleted. If there
        is no active litigation involving your account at the time of deletion, all data is immediately and permanently
        removed as described in section 2.
      </p>

      <h3 class="privacy__heading">8. Compliance with a legal obligation</h3>
      <p class="privacy__text">
        We will retain data only when we have a current legal obligation to do so (such as a valid court order or
        subpoena). Upon account deletion, if no such legal obligation exists, all data is immediately and permanently
        deleted. If a legal obligation requires temporary retention, we will notify you and delete the data as soon as
        the obligation expires.
      </p>

      <h3 class="privacy__heading">9. Further processing of data for statistical purposes</h3>
      <p class="privacy__text">
        In order to maintain statistics relating to the fasting habits of our user base and to allow you to visualize
        your own history and progress, we keep your fasting logs and other non-personal information, such as cycle
        metadata, while your account is active. This processing is compatible with the initial collection of your data,
        justified by the execution of the contract (providing you with your history). Upon account deletion, all of your
        individual fasting logs and personal statistics are permanently deleted from our database. We retain no
        identifiable information about your fasting history after account deletion.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="privacy__section">
      <h2 class="privacy__subtitle">Who has access to your data?</h2>
      <p class="privacy__text">
        Your data is hosted by secure professional service providers on servers located in the United States of America
        and Canada. The KETONE team is likely to access it within the framework and the limits of their functions. We do
        not sell or share your data with third-party advertisers.
      </p>
      <p class="privacy__text">Some of your data may be viewed or hosted strictly for operational purposes by:</p>
      <ul class="privacy__list">
        <li>
          Technical service providers assisting KETONE for the hosting, maintenance, and development of the app (e.g.,
          cloud infrastructure providers).
        </li>
        <li>
          Payment service providers (e.g., PayPal, Stripe, Patreon). Note: These providers process your financial data
          (such as credit card numbers) independently according to their own privacy policies; KETONE does not have
          access to your banking credentials.
        </li>
        <li>KETONE legal advisers, accounting firms, and lawyers (only if necessary for legal compliance).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="privacy__text">
        These providers are located in the United States, Canada and Mexico. We ensure that our subcontractors are
        reputable service providers offering appropriate security guarantees. When you delete your account, we instruct
        all service providers to permanently delete your data from their systems as well.
